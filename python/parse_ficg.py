# Friendship is Card Games text dump parser
#
# Given a text file containing a dump of card text from FanOfMostEverything's
# Friendship is Card Games posts, this script will attempt to parse it into a
# structured format and output the result as JSON. A "dump of card text", in
# this case, is a direct copy-paste of card listings from FanOfMostEverything's
# card blog posts.
#
# Example card dump:
#
#     Rainbow Dash 2RWU
#     Legendary Creature â€” Pegasus
#     Players other than Rainbow Dash's owner can't control it.
#     Flying, haste, double strike
#     Awesome, cool, and radical enough to distinguish the three.
#     2/3
#
# Because copy-pasting doesn't preserve formatting such as italics, there is
# no foolproof way to distinguish flavor text from rules text. The parser uses
# a detection algorithm to perform the separation automatically, although it
# isn't perfect and sometimes mistakes lines of rules text for flavor text.
