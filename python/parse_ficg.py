"""Friendship is Card Games text dump parser

Given a text file containing a dump of card text from FanOfMostEverything's
Friendship is Card Games posts, this script will attempt to parse it into a
structured format and output the result as JSON. A "dump of card text", in this
case, is a direct copy-paste of card listings from FanOfMostEverything's card
blog posts.

Example card dump:

    Rainbow Dash 2RWU
    Legendary Creature â€” Pegasus
    Players other than Rainbow Dash's owner can't control it.
    Flying, haste, double strike
    Awesome, cool, and radical enough to distinguish the three.
    2/3

Because copy-pasting doesn't preserve formatting such as italics, there is no
foolproof way to distinguish flavor text from rules text. The parser uses a
detection algorithm to perform the separation automatically, although it isn't
perfect and sometimes mistakes lines of rules text for flavor text.
