        <h1>About PonyMTG</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>PonyMTG</strong> is a card database for fan-made <em>Magic: the Gathering</em> sets based on
            <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>. The aim of this project is to ensure the preservation of MtG
            card sets made by the Brony community, and to make it easier for people to obtain playable decks of
            community-produced cards.
        </p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                PonyMTG is a constant work in progress. As such, there may be bugs and rendering errors that haven't
                yet been fixed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of the cards don't have all their information in the database yet, just their images. This means
                that the advanced search functionality (ie. search by mana type) isn't useful yet for most sets.
                Exceptions to this are Sorden's IPU set (he provided a Cockatrice file), and any set created by
                FanOfMostEverything (his cards are already in full text format).
            </li>
        </ul>
